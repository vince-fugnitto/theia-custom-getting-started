<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA<br/>EXAMPLE CUSTOM GETTING-STARTED EXTENSION</h2>

</div>

## Overview

The repository is an example of how an extension developer can make use of Theia's extension mechanisms (using `Dependency Injection) in order to customize pre-existing extensions/widgets easily. More information regarding dependency injection can be found [here](https://theia-ide.org/docs/services_and_contributions/).

The following `custom-getting-started` widget extends the base
[`getting-started`](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/packages/getting-started/src/browser/getting-started-widget.tsx) widget and updates the method `renderHeader()`.

Below is the comparison of the widget between both versions:

| Default `getting-started` | Custom `getting-started` |
|:---:|:---:|
|<img src="./assets/before.png" alt="before" /> | <img src="./assets/after.png" alt="after" /> |
